# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Replace legacy jQuery/Modernizr console implementation with modern, accessible ES modules while preserving the vintage UI.
- Introduce hashed, cache-friendly build outputs produced via esbuild and document new build/test tooling.
- Add tolerant `access` command parsing (accepts `access`, `Access`, `ACCESS`, and `aAccess`) along with automated unit tests.
- Refresh supporting pages (About, Error, The King) to remove deprecated assets, improve semantics, and drop unused Flash/JS dependencies.
